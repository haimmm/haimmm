# Haim's Github
Hi everyone and welcome to my page,
My name is Haim I'm a junior developer.
I love technologies, inovation, problem solving and everything related to computers.
I'm currently working as an IT Support Specialist for several years and coding as a hobby, 
but I'm trying to flip my situation as I find coding more interesting for me.

I started with languages like Java and Python, but this year I've decided to pick up web development as my my goal.
So I picked a bootcamp and currently I'm a student of the [Israeli Tech challenge](https://www.itc.tech/), expected to graduate at the end of May.
In the bootcamp I'm learning the core tools of web development, including HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, NODE JS, MONGO DB.

In this profile you can find my projects such as:


Currently I'm working on a real portfolio to show my skills and project and a better light.

Im addition I'm hard working on my final project including all the stacks I mentioned above.

Also all my curreent projects will be highly improved in the near future, current I'm following course projects and schedules which means quantity over quality.
