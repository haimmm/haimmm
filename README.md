Hi everyone and welcome to my page, \
My name is Haim I'm a junior developer. \
I love technologies, inovation, problem solving and everything related to computers. \
I'm currently working as an IT Support Specialist for several years and coding as a hobby, \
but I'm trying to flip my situation as I find coding more interesting for me.

I started with languages like Java and Python, but this year I've decided to dive into web development. \
So I picked a bootcamp and now I'm graduated from [Israeli Tech challenge](https://www.itc.tech/). \
In the bootcamp I'm learning the core tools of web development, including HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, NODE JS, MONGO DB.

In this profile you can find my projects such as:
- [React Pet Adoption](https://github.com/haimmm/PetAdoption)
- [React Notes App](https://github.com/haimmm/React-Notes-App)
- [Stock Search- vanillaJS](https://github.com/haimmm/Stock-Exchange-Project)

Currently I'm working on a real portfolio to show my skills and projecst in better light. \
In addition I'm hard working on my final project including all the stacks I mentioned above. \
Also all my curreent projects will be highly improved in the near future, I want to improve the design, functionality and mobile device support.
